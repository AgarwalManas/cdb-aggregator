# Consumer-Driven Banking Aggregator

[![CI](https://github.com/AgarwalManas/cdb-aggregator/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/AgarwalManas/cdb-aggregator/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

An **FDX-aligned account aggregator** for Canada's Consumer-Driven Banking era,
built around a **first-class consent and traceability layer** — the part that
separates an accredited open-banking participant from a credential-storing screen
scraper.

It ingests data from three deliberately different mock sources, normalizes them
into one FDX-shaped model, and gates **every read** on an active, in-scope,
revocable consent — logging each access to an append-only trail and returning only
the fields the customer actually shared. On top of that sits a unified net-worth
dashboard and an agentic-delegation layer that hands a **scoped, revocable,
fully-logged** task to an AI agent.

---

## The regulatory moment

Canada's open-banking framework just moved from proposal to law:

- **Bill C-15 received Royal Assent on March 26, 2026**, replacing the original
  Consumer-Driven Banking Act with a comprehensive new **CDBA** and moving
  oversight to the **Bank of Canada**.
- **Phase 1 (read access)** was targeted for early 2026; **Phase 2 (write —
  payment initiation, account switching)** for mid-2027, contingent on Real-Time
  Rail. Timing is genuinely uncertain — this project is built *for* that world,
  it does not claim to be *in* it yet.
- The technical standard is **[FDX](https://financialdataexchange.org/)** —
  OAuth 2.0 + FAPI, granular time-limited permissions, and five principles:
  **Control, Access, Transparency, Traceability, Security.**

Most aggregation in Canada still runs on **screen-scraping and shared
credentials** — brittle, and far more access than any feature needs. This project
is built the other way around: FDX-first, with consent and an auditable access
trail as the core product. See **[docs/screen-scraping.md](docs/screen-scraping.md)**
for the full "why screen-scraping is about to break" argument.

### What it is — and isn't

- It **is** a working demonstration of the architecture open banking calls for:
  a canonical FDX model, adapters that normalize messy sources into it, and a
  consent layer that gates, logs, and minimizes every read.
- It is **not** a live integration with any real institution or regulator. The
  data sources are mocks; persistence is in-memory (see
  [ADR 0006](docs/adr/0006-in-memory-stores-and-mocks.md)). It models the
  standard rather than claiming certified connectivity.

---

## The star: consent & traceability

Every capability below is enforced at a **single choke point** — a consent gate
that all data reads pass through ([ADR 0003](docs/adr/0003-consent-as-a-gate.md)):

- **Granular scopes** — account details, balances, transactions, investment
  holdings, customer identity, customer contact — granted per connection.
- **Time-limited & revocable** — grants expire; one-tap revoke stops access
  immediately.
- **Enforced on every read** — no active, in-scope grant covering the account
  means no data, with a specific reason (`NO_CONSENT` / `INACTIVE` /
  `SCOPE_NOT_GRANTED` / `ACCOUNT_NOT_COVERED`).
- **Traceability** — an append-only audit log records every access (allowed *or*
  denied), tied to the grant it relied on, noting what was disclosed and what was
  withheld ([ADR 0004](docs/adr/0004-traceability-and-minimization.md)).
- **Data minimization** — a read returns only the fields the granted scopes
  permit; balances you didn't share drop out of net worth as *excluded*, not
  silently.
- **Agentic delegation** — a task delegated to an AI agent is just another consent
  to an agent identity: scoped, revocable, logged, and suggestion-only
  ([ADR 0005](docs/adr/0005-agentic-delegation-as-consent.md)).

## Architecture

                                    delegated agent (scoped, revocable, logged)
```

Three sources with three very different shapes normalize into one model; the gate
sits between that model and everything that consumes it — the dashboards and the
agent alike.

## Quickstart

Requires **Python 3.11+** and **Node 20+**.

```bash
# 1. Install the backend (with dev tools)
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# 2. Run the aggregator API
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --app-dir backend      # http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

- <http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs> — interactive OpenAPI docs
- <http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/net-worth>, `/api/connections`, `/api/audit`, … — the
  dashboard API

### Run the dashboard

```bash
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev            # http://localhost:5173
```

Three tabs, all read through the consent gate:

- **Overview** — household net worth, merged accounts, merged transaction feed.
- **Consent & Traceability** — connections, scopes, expiry, one-tap revoke, and
  the audit log (with *who* accessed — aggregator vs. delegated agent).
- **Assistant** — delegate a scoped, revocable task to the idle-cash agent; it
  suggests, it never acts.

### Run the mock providers (optional)

Each is a standalone service the adapters can talk to over HTTP:

```bash
uvicorn app.providers.mock_fdx_bank.app:app --app-dir backend --port 9001  # OAuth2 + FDX
uvicorn app.providers.legacy_bank.app:app   --app-dir backend --port 9002  # messy schema
uvicorn app.providers.scraper_bank.app:app  --app-dir backend --port 9003  # HTML to scrape
```

See each provider's `README.md` for endpoints and how it differs from FDX.

## Testing & CI

```bash
pytest                                               # the full suite
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing           # with coverage
```

- **100% line coverage**, enforced in CI (`--cov-fail-under=100`).
- **Warnings are errors** — nothing slips through silently in a financial
  codebase.
- **[GitHub Actions](.github/workflows/ci.yml)** runs ruff (lint + format),
  the tests + coverage gate, and the frontend build on every push and PR.

Configuration is typed (`backend/app/core/config.py`); copy `.env.example` to
`.env` to override (all vars prefixed `CDB_`).

## Design decisions

The *why* behind the structure is recorded as **[ADRs](docs/adr/)**:

| # | Decision |
|---|----------|
| [0001](docs/adr/0001-backend-fastapi.md) | Backend: FastAPI (Python) |
| [0002](docs/adr/0002-fdx-aligned-canonical-model.md) | FDX-aligned model; `Decimal` money; camelCase wire format |
| [0003](docs/adr/0003-consent-as-a-gate.md) | Consent as a gate every read passes |
| [0004](docs/adr/0004-traceability-and-minimization.md) | Append-only audit + field-level minimization |
| [0005](docs/adr/0005-agentic-delegation-as-consent.md) | Agent delegation as a consent to an agent identity |
| [0006](docs/adr/0006-in-memory-stores-and-mocks.md) | In-memory stores + mock providers |

## Build timeline

Built in **Items** (see [`docs/build-todo.md`](docs/build-todo.md)), in
dependency order, each tagged so the history is a navigable timeline:

| Phase | Items | What lands |
|------:|-------|-----------|
| **0 — Foundation** | 1–2 | Repo scaffold; FDX-aligned canonical model |
| **1 — Ingestion** | 3–6 | Mock FDX bank; messy bank; normalizer; screen-scraping contrast |
| **2 — Consent ★** | 7–9 | Consent lifecycle + enforcement; audit + minimization; consent dashboard |
| **3 — Aggregation UX** | 10 | Unified accounts + household net-worth dashboard |
| **4 — Differentiator** | 11 | Agentic delegation / intent layer |
| **5 — Packaging** | 12–14 | Test hardening + CI; README + ADRs + explainer; project-review walkthrough |

```bash
git tag                      # item-01 … item-14
git checkout item-07         # inspect any milestone (e.g. the consent layer)
```

## Trade-offs & honest scope

- **Mock sources, in-memory persistence.** Deliberate — it demonstrates the
  architecture without an external dependency, and the store interfaces are the
  seam where a database drops in ([ADR 0006](docs/adr/0006-in-memory-stores-and-mocks.md)).
- **FDX-aligned, not FDX-complete.** A faithful, pragmatic subset of the spec.
- **The agent is deterministic by default.** The differentiator is the
  *governance* around a delegated actor, not the AI; the engine is swappable for
  an LLM without changing any of it ([ADR 0005](docs/adr/0005-agentic-delegation-as-consent.md)).
- **Built for the standard, honest about timing.** No claim of certified
  connectivity that doesn't exist yet.

## Tech stack

- **Backend:** Python 3.11, FastAPI, Pydantic v2, httpx, BeautifulSoup
- **Frontend:** React 18 + Vite
- **Tooling:** pytest (+ coverage), ruff, GitHub Actions
